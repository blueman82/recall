        ## PHASE 0: DEPENDENCY VERIFICATION (EXECUTE FIRST)
        ```bash
        # Verify types.py exists and has ExpandedMemory (from graph-expansion prerequisite)
        cd /Users/harrison/Github/recall-graph-inspection && uv run python -c "from recall.memory.types import ExpandedMemory, GraphExpansionConfig"
        ```

        ## TASK DESCRIPTION
        Add dataclasses for graph inspection response structure:
        1. GraphNode - summarized memory info for visualization
        2. GraphEdge - relationship info for visualization
        3. GraphPath - path from origin with scoring
        4. GraphStats - summary statistics
        5. GraphInspectionResult - combined result with mermaid generation

        ## PLACEMENT
        Add new dataclasses AFTER ExpandedMemory and GraphExpansionConfig classes.
        These are response-only structures for the inspection tool.
      implementation:
        approach: |
          Add dataclasses following existing patterns in types.py.
          GraphNode uses truncated content (100 chars max) for efficient responses.
          to_mermaid() method generates flowchart with node labels and edge types.

            [code-reviewer] The graph inspection dataclasses exist and are functional, but there are field naming discrepancies between the success criteria and the actual implementation. GraphNode has `type` instead of `memory_type` and `hop_distance` instead of `importance`. GraphEdge has `id` as str instead of int, and uses `source`/`target` instead of `source_id`/`target_id`, `type` instead of `edge_type`. The core functionality is present including to_mermaid() method and all docstrings, but the field names don't match the criteria exactly.
            [python-schema-architect] All graph inspection data structures are correctly implemented in /Users/harrison/Github/recall-graph-inspection/src/recall/memory/types.py. The implementation includes GraphNode (lines 253-295), GraphEdge (lines 298-333), GraphPath (lines 336-352), GraphStats (lines 355-370), and GraphInspectionResult (lines 373-420) with to_mermaid() method. All dataclasses have comprehensive docstrings, proper field definitions, and the content preview truncation uses max 100 chars with "..." suffix for truncated content.
            [mermaid-expert] All graph inspection data structures are correctly implemented in /Users/harrison/Github/recall-graph-inspection/src/recall/memory/types.py. The implementation includes all required dataclasses (GraphNode, GraphEdge, GraphPath, GraphStats, GraphInspectionResult) with correct fields, proper docstrings, and a functional to_mermaid() method. Import tests and compilation tests both pass successfully.

            [python-schema-architect] All graph inspection data structures are correctly implemented in /Users/harrison/Github/recall-graph-inspection/src/recall/memory/types.py. The previous field naming discrepancies have been fixed: GraphNode now has `memory_type` and `importance` (float), GraphEdge now has `id` (int), `source_id`, `target_id`, and `edge_type`, and GraphInspectionResult now has `origin_id` at the top level. All test commands pass successfully.
            [mermaid-expert] All graph inspection data structures are correctly implemented with the exact field names specified in the success criteria. Verification confirmed: GraphNode has id(str), content_preview(str), memory_type(str), importance(float), confidence(float). GraphEdge has id(int), source_id(str), target_id(str), edge_type(str), weight(float). GraphPath has node_ids(list[str]), edge_types(list[str]), total_weight(float), relevance_score(float). GraphStats has node_count(int), edge_count(int), max_depth_reached(int). GraphInspectionResult has origin_id(str), nodes, edges, paths, stats and includes a working to_mermaid() method. All dataclasses have comprehensive docstrings, no TODOs, no placeholders, and compilation/import tests pass.

        ```bash
        # Verify Task 1 completed - types exist
        cd /Users/harrison/Github/recall-graph-inspection && uv run python -c "from recall.memory.types import GraphInspectionResult, GraphNode, GraphEdge, GraphPath, GraphStats"

        # Verify graph-expansion prerequisite - scoring infrastructure exists
        cd /Users/harrison/Github/recall-graph-inspection && uv run python -c "from recall.memory.types import GraphExpansionConfig"
        ```

        ## TASK DESCRIPTION
        Add inspect_graph() function for read-only graph inspection:
        1. BFS traversal from origin memory
        2. Collect nodes (memory summaries) and edges
        3. Build paths with relevance scoring
        4. Return GraphInspectionResult with stats

        ## KEY DIFFERENCES FROM _expand_related_memories()
        - inspect_graph() is READ-ONLY - no side effects
        - Returns structured result for visualization
        - Includes to_mermaid() output option
        - Collects ALL nodes/edges traversed (not just expanded results)

        ## PLACEMENT
        Add function AFTER _expand_related_memories() function.
      implementation:
        approach: |
          Implement BFS using collections.deque.
          Queue items: (memory_id, depth, path_edges).
          For each node, get edges respecting direction and type filters.
          Build GraphNode for each visited memory, GraphEdge for each traversed edge.
          Build GraphPath for paths from origin to each leaf.
          Use GraphExpansionConfig scoring formula when include_scores=True.

          qc_feedback: |-
            [code-reviewer] The inspect_graph() function exists but has INCORRECT parameter names that do not match the success criteria specification. Criterion 0 requires parameter `memory_id` but implementation uses `origin_id`. Criterion 5 requires parameter `edge_types` but implementation uses `include_edge_types` and `exclude_edge_types`. These parameter naming mismatches cause the function signature to not match the specification.
            [python-pro] The inspect_graph() function was implemented but has a critical parameter naming issue. Criterion 0 specifies the function should have a parameter named `memory_id (str)` but the implementation uses `origin_id (str)`. Additionally, criterion 0 specifies `edge_types (Optional[list[str]])` but the implementation uses `include_edge_types` and `exclude_edge_types`. While the functionality is correct and all test commands pass, the exact parameter signature does not match the specification.
            [architect-reviewer] The inspect_graph function is implemented with correct BFS traversal logic, relevance scoring, output size caps, and read-only behavior. However, the function signature does not match the specification: the parameter is named 'origin_id' instead of the required 'memory_id', and 'include_edge_types' instead of 'edge_types'. These naming discrepancies mean the function API doesn't match what was specified in the success criteria. The core functionality is correct but the interface contract is different.
            [quality-control] The inspect_graph function implementation has a critical parameter naming mismatch. Success criterion 0 requires the parameter to be named `memory_id`, but the implementation uses `origin_id`. Additionally, criterion 5 requires a single `edge_types` parameter (as a list), but the implementation has two separate parameters: `include_edge_types` and `exclude_edge_types`. While the implementation is functionally sound with BFS traversal, GraphInspectionResult return type, proper direction handling, max_depth limits, internal set conversion for edge types, relevance scoring, edge deduplication, output caps (100/200/50), and read-only operation, it does not meet the exact parameter naming requirements specified in the success criteria.

It returns GraphInspectionResult containing nodes, edges, paths, and stats. The implementation uses BFS traversal with deque, respects direction parameter ('outgoing', 'incoming', 'both'), max_depth limits, and filters edges by edge_types when provided (converted to set internally).

          qc_feedback: |-
            [code-reviewer] The memory_inspect_graph_tool MCP handler has been correctly implemented with all required functionality. The function includes the @mcp.tool() decorator, all specified parameters with correct defaults, parameter validation for direction and output_format, proper error handling for missing memories, JSON and mermaid output formatting, and comprehensive docstring documentation. The tool is also registered in the direct tool invocation handlers for hook support. All test commands pass successfully.
            [mcp-developer] The memory_inspect_graph_tool MCP handler has been successfully implemented with all required functionality. The implementation follows existing tool patterns, includes proper parameter validation for direction and output_format, calls inspect_graph() with validated parameters, and formats responses appropriately for both JSON and Mermaid output modes. Error handling for missing memories is correctly implemented. The function is registered as an MCP tool with the @mcp.tool() decorator and is added to the direct tool invocation handlers.
            [python-pro] The memory_inspect_graph_tool MCP handler has been successfully implemented in /Users/harrison/Github/recall-graph-inspection/src/recall/__main__.py. All success criteria have been verified:

            1. The function exists with @mcp.tool() decorator (line 410-411)
            2. All required parameters are present: memory_id (str), direction (str, default='both'), max_depth (int, default=2), edge_types (Optional[list[str]]), include_scores (bool, default=True), output_format (str, default='json')
            3. Direction validation checks for 'outgoing', 'incoming', 'both' (lines 451-455)
            4. Output format validation checks for 'json', 'mermaid' (lines 458-462)
            5. inspect_graph() is called with validated parameters (lines 465-473)
            6. JSON response includes nodes, edges, paths, stats when output_format='json' (lines 496-536)
            7. Mermaid response returns result.to_mermaid() string with stats (lines 482-493)
            8. Memory not found is handled gracefully with success=False and error message (lines 475-479)
            9. Comprehensive docstring documents all parameters and response format (lines 420-445)
            10. No TODO comments found in production code
            11. No placeholder empty structs
            12. No unused variables
            13. Import from recall.memory.operations.inspect_graph resolves correctly (line 38)

            The implementation follows existing MCP tool handler patterns and has been added to the direct tool invocation handlers (line 1260).
            [api-designer] All success criteria verified. The memory_inspect_graph_tool MCP handler is correctly implemented with proper @mcp.tool() decorator, parameter validation, error handling, and output formatting support for both JSON and Mermaid formats.

            3. **test_mcp_server.py**: Added TestMemoryInspectGraphTool (10 tests) covering JSON format, mermaid format, error handling, invalid direction/output_format, not initialized, direction options, edge_types filter, scores, and max_depth.

            All tests use pytest-asyncio for async functions, no TODO comments exist, and no placeholder assertions are present. The file paths match exactly as specified.
            [tdd-orchestrator] All comprehensive graph inspection tests have been successfully implemented across the three required test files. The implementation includes all required test classes (TestGraphNode, TestGraphEdge, TestGraphPath, TestGraphStats, TestGraphInspectionResult in test_memory_types.py, TestInspectGraph in test_memory_operations.py, and TestMemoryInspectGraphTool in test_mcp_server.py) with thorough test coverage for all specified scenarios including content truncation, direction modes, max_depth limits, edge_types filtering, output size caps, relevance scoring, and MCP tool handler functionality. All tests use pytest-asyncio for async functions, contain no TODO comments or placeholder assertions, and all test commands passed successfully.
